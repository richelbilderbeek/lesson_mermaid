# Reflection 2024-04-17

There were 12 learners in the classroom.
I asked Meike to observe.

Usually, when doing a Prior, I've done this in an online
setting. Usually, what I do, is stop sharing the screen
and open up the 'For teachers' section with the Prior in the
course material. In a regular classroom setting, however, this
could not be done elegantly. Next classroom setting, print out the Priors.

It felt that the learners were twice as fast. In hindsight,
they went through the schedule indeed a bit faster:
instead of taking (50 + 30 =) 80 mins,
they went through it in (50 + 15 =) 65 mins.
This means they were about ((65 - 80) / 80 = âˆ’0.1875 =) 20% faster.

This is the schedule, with the changes indicated:

Time |Description
-----|-----------
9:00 |[Intro to mermaid](../../docs/sessions/intro_to_mermaid.md)
9:05 -> 9:10 |[Your first mermaid experience](../../docs/sessions/first_experience.md)
9:25 |[Mermaid terminology](../../docs/sessions/mermaid_terminology.md)
10:00 -> 9:45 |[Publishing your graphs](../../docs/sessions/publishing_graphs.md) or [Improving the layout of your graphs](../../docs/sessions/improving_layout.md)
9:50 |Break
10:00 |[Publishing your graphs](../../docs/sessions/publishing_graphs.md) or [Improving the layout of your graphs](../../docs/sessions/improving_layout.md)
10:30 -> 10:15 |End

Due to the higher pace, me and Meike decided to have a break 15 minutes earlier,
so that the next lecturer could also start 15 minutes earlier.
I think this was a good choice.

I was able to see the progress of the learners well and had short one-on-ones
with around two-thirds of them.

There were some things in the exercises that could be improved (thanks
to Sara, from Belgium, for pointing that out).

A weakness was that I did not share the learning objectives at the start of
each session. This is because these boxes were folded.

Summarizing the lesson, I think it was a relaxed, lightweight session
that reached its teaching goals, albeit executed a bit sloppily.

Reading Meike's observations, I see that indeed the schedule is indeed
as shown above. Monologues:

- 9:00-9:09: 9 minutes
- 9:23-9:27: 4 minutes
- 9:45-9:50: 5 minutes
- 10:00-10:01: 1 minutes
- 10:13-10:15: 2 minutes

I talked (9 + 4 + 5 + 1 + 2 =) 21 minutes of 65 minutes,
which is around 32% of the time. I feel this is too much.
I think this can be explained by having a better rule what yes/no
to discuss.

Now [the anonymous feedback](../../evaluations/20241017/README.md) is in,
with two responses:

```text
5/5
```

Could have been worse :-) ! And

```text
I loved it! Fun and easy to follow! I like the way you teach, but sometimes it was a bit flickering while walking back and forth.. 

In retrosepctive, I would have appreciated some more time on showing details in the process of constructing the mindmaps/flowcharts..

Keep it up!
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

I think this is great feedback! Indeed,
I should have been doing a stronger
Feedback phase and demo live how to build these. I'll try to do so next time.

Also, the 'a bit flickering while walking back and forth' is correct: my laptop
was far away from the screen, so I had to walk more than I'd have liked too.
I could not reasonably have fixed this, yet I enjoy such an observant learner!
