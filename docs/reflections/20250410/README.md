I enjoyed working with the group.
I've seen half of the groups have fun by making Mermaid graphs
and had short chats with most of them.

I was hesitant to put them in groups of 2, but I just mindlessly
followed the pedagogic literature and did so. It was the right
choice.

My biggest mistake was a planning mistake: instead of having a break
from 9:50-10:00, I gave them a break from 9:50-10:10.
As I already said so, I stuck with that too long break.
Due to this, there was not enough time for the GitHub exercise at all.
I did improvise by asking people with a GitHub account to demonstrate.
These three learners did so and did have enough time to publish a
mermaid graph, so that is at least something. But it was not a
complete session at all :-/

Next time, only do mindmap and flowchart: it gaves a lot of air to the course
that the learners can use. I expect that the learners write down that they
needed more time, and I already agree. Note that I already simplified the
course material to have more time for exercises.
