I had a good time with the group.
I could argue that it may have been too informal
for my own liking, but I think I did achieve most learning outcomes.
Also, I felt it was natural to continue the relaxed atmosphere
set by the previous teacher.

Note that I did not prepare much. There was no time,
nor was there any need. This session seems
to get more of a habit to me. It would be nice if
I could find a way to challenge myself more here.

[Other feedback](../../evaluations/20251002/other_feedback.txt):

- Thanks for being so upbeat and friendly:)
- It is great to have to opportunity for some practice
  and to play around with the tool.
- Very active session, it was good to learn in pairs to figure stuff out.
  I almost had an issue with publishing, as the instruction code line included
  [ ] around the code but your demo helped solve this issue.
  Also first time for me to create a repository on GitHub,
  I now understand that better too. Thanks for the session!

I have updated the course material and remove the more cryptic
text.

- I struggled to change the layout of both the mind map
  and flow chart to align it with my thoughts/ story.

This is my bad! I should have told more often that the
correct layout is not a goal of Mermaid

## Conclusion

It went reasonably well. Due to my informality and unpreparedness,
I would rate my teaching a 7 out of 10.
