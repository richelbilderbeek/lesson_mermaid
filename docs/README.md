# Frequently Asked Questions

## When to follow the course

### When should I follow this course?

When you want to decide to use Mermaid yes/no.

### When should I consider to **not** follow this course?

These are the reasons to consider to **not** follow this course:

#### Reason 1: you want to use Mermaid in an advanced way

When you have done your first Mermaid diagram and
expect to learn new and more advanced things.

In this case, the course will go too slow for you.

However, you will probably be put to work by the teachers
to help out other learners.
If you like to test your own knowledge by teaching others,
you will likely thrive in the course.

#### Reason 2: you have social anxiety

When you have social anxiety.

In this case, the course will be too social for you.

However, in this course, it is perfectly OK to give a wrong
answer or to say 'I do not know'. This is what a former
learner had to say on this:

You are welcome to try and leave anytime you want.
The course material is made for self-study too, with videos
for all exercises.
Do fill in [the evaluation](../evaluation.md)
when you leave early :-)

## Teaching

### Why is the course learner-centered?

Because that is good teaching.

This course defines good teaching as 'evidence-based methods to let learners
acquire new skills and the monitoring of this acquisition'.
This means that it should be observed that learners need more/less to time
to practice and following the schedule based on that. Learner-centered teaching
has an effect size from 0.36 `[Hattie ranking]`
or 0.64/0.70 `[Cornelius-White, 2007][Hattie, 2012]`.
