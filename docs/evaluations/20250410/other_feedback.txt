is nice to do exercises together, they were well planned and organised. much better than a boring ppt
I have enjoyed this course. I have learned to use different softwares and improved in my visual presentations. I would recommend this course to other PhD students.
Great way to learn about this tool! I think it could maybe be improved by making it more relevant to our own research.

It is a really useful course, and interactive.
Great session! it was very dynamic and hands on. The instructor's teaching style is also very nice.

Interactive session. Like it!
Nice and clear structure. Enough time for most exercises. I like the small break-out rooms. No need to explicitly suggest how to interact in the break out rooms. I understand the wish for people to turn on camera but would prefer it to be voluntary still.
