[Other feedback](other_feedback.txt):

- Thanks for being so upbeat and friendly:)
- It is great to have to opportunity for some practice and to play around with the tool.
- Very active session, it was good to learn in pairs to figure stuff out. I almost had an issue with publishing, as the instruction code line included [ ] around the code but your demo helped solve this issue. Also first time for me to create a repository on GitHub, I now understand that better too. Thanks for the session!
- I struggled to change the layout of both the mind map and flow chart to align it with my thoughts/ story.
