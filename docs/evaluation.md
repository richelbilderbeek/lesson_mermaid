# Evaluation

Here is a simple form for suggesting anything anonymously:

- [Any feedback during the day](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdia2vLqdsE8G05fMHQZOyqqpIoOSaPOYhQk6LwqymXyOYbsg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

???- question "For teachers: what is in that form?"

    Thanks for your feedback.
    This feedback will be published as-is at the end of the day,
    if and only if there are no personal details (email, address, etc.)
    in the feedback.
    Do mention the teachers, assistants, etc by name!
