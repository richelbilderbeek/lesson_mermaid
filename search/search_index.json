If so, please specify which parts and in what way","text":"<ul> <li>I especially liked the setting with break out rooms and small drawing tasks   to engage people! You managed to have us build a connection as a   group, even though it is harder over zoom!   The size of the group also helped with that I suppose.   Also, I liked to mostly have the teaching in the morning   and working on our own in the afternoon.   I think the feedback sessions went really well and   I was surprised that I could give (hopefully)   useful feedback to class mates even though I did   not necessarily understand their research very well.   That proved to me that you did a really good job teaching us   the skill of critically assessing   visuals! :)</li> <li>We have time to explore the software and make graphical   abstract and figures for our own project.</li> <li>The type of exercises, the pace of the course + the constant feedback   led to acquiring an actual skill, that we can use for our projects.   Illustrating can be chaotic in the beginning,   especially with specific softwares,   so this course helped having a clear view on where to begin.   Also, this course provided enough material for future need,   in case we need help on this topic.</li> <li>This was the best full online course I have had.   The amount of interaction was great,   so please keep these discussion/break out sessions in   the course.</li> <li>The teachers were excellent and actively tried to make the content engaging   (even the coding!).   The teachers were very reachable by slack   too. I learnt valuable knowledge in how to apply design principles   to communicate my science. I like how we have each other feedback and we   also got feedback from the teachers too.</li> <li>Very interesting and fun course,   Meike were highly engaged and really offered to help   and provide feedback continuously during the course!</li> <li>Two of the lectures i particularly enjoyed and were excellent.   I also enjoyed the examination format, as it was both useful for our work,   while also being part of the course</li> <li>Everything was great!   This was definitely the best course I have followed at KI!   I liked the balance between lectures and working by ourselves.   The lectures were also fun because they were quite interactive   and the little exercises we did during the lectures   were very helpful to get in the   process.   I got many insights about how to create better visuals and   it was good to get feedback from the teachers and the other students.   Although we are all from very different fields,   it was helpful to understand how others perceive your figures.   These two weeks flew by and although I had to work on quite some other things   beside the course, I really enjoyed every minute I spent on   this course :)</li> <li>All the lectures and practice exercises were very well developed   to improve our skills in scientific illustration and data visualisation.   I really enjoyed to do the assignments because I could use my own data   do develop something I could use later on in my publications or   presentations. It was also fun to know all the logic behind the way our   brain receive and interpret an image, and the ways we could improve   our illustrations for a better communication process.   Also the use of different softwares and the potential of each one.   I learned a lot and I am   very grateful I have the opportunity to take this course on time   before my first manuscripts submissions.   I was a little bit reluctant about being   100% online course, but the way it was conduced, the interactions,   the management of time for each task made it easier. Congratulations for   all professionals involved on teaching with high quality in the course.</li> <li>I really liked the style of how and when we received feedback   on the hand ins in the course and how much support was given when working   on the assignments.</li> <li>very practical :)</li> <li>Interactive sessions and hands on activities during the session.</li> <li>I really enjoyed the Adobe illustrator activities to practice.   I tried before to learn with youtube videos but it was highly confusing.   Doing the   activities like this help to learn how to use the different tools   in a simple and helpful way.</li> <li>Everything about this course was great!   From the topics to the way it is taught.   I particularly enjoyed the peer-review and team work sessions   where the instructors were also coming to check in and   give input about the task.   This is one of the best online courses I\u2019ve ever attended.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"evaluations/20250410/#17-do-you-have-any-recommendations-as-to-how-the-course-could-be-improved-if-so-please-specify-which-parts-and-how","title":"17. Do you have any recommendations as to how the course could be improved? If so, please specify which parts and how","text":"<ul> <li>Maybe spend more time for Mermaid.   It was a very interesting tool but in just a short time.   I also would recommend to keep the course with students   with different background because I learned a lot from them and   also received valuable feedback for improving my figures   (maybe try to keep spreading the word out of KI).</li> <li>For me the less useful parts were the introduction to R/ggplot2,   because I already had some programming background,   so although I enjoyed the lectures from Martin and Richel,   it would have been nicer for me to have used that time to work   on the poster/figures myself.   Maybe it can be set up more flexible   that you can choose to which lectures to attend.</li> <li>I think it would be nice to have on session in the beginning   of the second week on how to transform your own data into tidy data   with which you are able to work in R/ggplot2.</li> <li>A recommendation is to implement one or two more lectures   with a format similar to Martin Jonnson's,   where we could follow his slides - even later offline - one by one,   to create a graph.   My recommendation is to do something similar with a complicated illustration,   so we can understand even better the process of how to start from   an empty artboard and end up with a high-quality creative illustration.</li> <li>My only critique would be to maybe ask students at the start of the course   their prior coding knowledge. As in the course information it is written   like you need R and illustrator.   But the course is actually completable with python and Inkscape/designer.   If there could be some sort of support possible for students   who prefer python over R that would be great too.</li> <li>It might be nice to introduce ggplot data visualisation earlier in week 1,   so there is a bit more time to learn to work with this programm and   already get feedback together   with the graphical abstract at the start of week 2.</li> <li>I would have liked to have some more optional   adobe illustrator activities to do.</li> <li>There was a lot to do during the course which required more working hours   than expected, even though it probably on individual level was up   to the student to decide when the assignments were \"good enough\",   but maybe clarify what is really necessary for the course purpose   in contrast to individual development and individual choices.</li> <li>In general, I really loved to course,   so this is only small details and a personal feeling!</li> </ul> <p>I felt like it was quite a lot of submissions...   but I was also attempting to make a whole poster and   there was not enough time for that...   I think it would have been less stressful to submit maybe   only a rough outline of a poster or graphical abstract   and then focus on one or two illustrations and make those really nice   using all the 3D and shading and colouring tools we learned...   For the feedback I had a hard time understanding the difference between   first and second feedback person and I think it would be fine   to just let the first person say whatever comes to mind   and the second one adding if they have any further comment... - I feel like the use of adobe/ inkscape could have been better explained.   The slides that I used were interactive and were good,   but i had to look at further youtube videos on it as well.   I liked that there was a variety of choice of software   at varying price points, but considering i was just starting,   I used the free choice.   That was perhaps a bit more limiting in my ability to create something,   though I'm not sure as I did not try the others.   The last thing I would say is perhaps to put in some examples   of work that is not so refined and submitted to journals and magazines -   something that might be a bit more achievable for PhD/ post doc work.   Most of what we saw was of such high quality that i was inspired by it,   but had no idea how to achieve that. - more examples of good scientific illustrations of the most common   plots -&gt; a good bar graph, regression analysis, correlation matrix,   heat map, forest plot etc. - Maybe include one session in person for the people that are in Stockholm   or that can attend. It would be great to have the last session be   in person and receive feedback from the others. - I guess the feedback should also be in written format from peers too.   It will help the creator to incorporate and select the best suggestions   from them in the final versions.</p>"},{"location":"evaluations/20251002/","title":"Evaluation","text":"<ul> <li>Lesson plan</li> <li>Evaluation</li> <li>Reflection</li> <li>Success score: 90%</li> <li>Number of learners: 14</li> <li>Number of evaluation responses: 14 (100%)</li> </ul> <p>Below are the evaluation results.</p>"},{"location":"evaluations/20251002/#anonymous-feedback","title":"Anonymous feedback","text":"<p>There was none.</p>"},{"location":"evaluations/20251002/#course-evaluation-results","title":"Course evaluation results","text":"<p>)</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Other feedback:</p> <ul> <li>Thanks for being so upbeat and friendly:)</li> <li>It is great to have to opportunity for some practice   and to play around with the tool.</li> <li>Very active session, it was good to learn in pairs to figure stuff out.

You managed to have us build a connection as a   group, even though it is harder over zoom!   The size of the group also helped with that I suppose.   Also, I liked to mostly have the teaching in the morning   and working on our own in the afternoon.   I think the feedback sessions went really well and   I was surprised that I could give (hopefully)   useful feedback to class mates even though I did   not necessarily understand their research very well.   That proved to me that you did a really good job teaching us   the skill of critically assessing   visuals! :)</li> <li>We have time to explore the software and make graphical   abstract and figures for our own project.</li> <li>The type of exercises, the pace of the course + the constant feedback   led to acquiring an actual skill, that we can use for our projects.   Illustrating can be chaotic in the beginning,   especially with specific softwares,   so this course helped having a clear view on where to begin.   Also, this course provided enough material for future need,   in case we need help on this topic.</li> <li>This was the best full online course I have had.

This was definitely the best course I have followed at KI!   I liked the balance between lectures and working by ourselves.   The lectures were also fun because they were quite interactive   and the little exercises we did during the lectures   were very helpful to get in the   process.   I got many insights about how to create better visuals and   it was good to get feedback from the teachers and the other students.   Although we are all from very different fields,   it was helpful to understand how others perceive your figures.   These two weeks flew by and although I had to work on quite some other things   beside the course, I really enjoyed every minute I spent on   this course :)</li> <li>All the lectures and practice exercises were very well developed   to improve our skills in scientific illustration and data visualisation.   I really enjoyed to do the assignments because I could use my own data   do develop something I could use later on in my publications or   presentations. It was also fun to know all the logic behind the way our   brain receive and interpret an image, and the ways we could improve   our illustrations for a better communication process.   Also the use of different softwares and the potential of each one.   I learned a lot and I am   very grateful I have the opportunity to take this course on time   before my first manuscripts submissions.

It was a very interesting tool but in just a short time.</li> </ul> <p>Hey, that is me :-)</p> <p>I also would recommend to keep the course with students   with different background because I learned a lot from them and   also received valuable feedback for improving my figures   (maybe try to keep spreading the word out of KI).</p> <ul> <li>For me the less useful parts were the introduction to R/ggplot2,   because I already had some programming background,   so although I enjoyed the lectures from Martin and Richel,   it would have been nicer for me to have used that time to work   on the poster/figures myself.   Maybe it can be set up more flexible   that you can choose to which lectures to attend.</li> </ul> <p>I agree that this can be made optional.</p> <ul> <li>I think it would be nice to have on session in the beginning   of the second week on how to transform your own data into tidy data   with which you are able to work in R/ggplot2.</li> </ul> <p>I can teach that! It is chapters 3 and 5 in the book. I would need an extra two hours for that.</p> <ul> <li>A recommendation is to implement one or two more lectures   with a format similar to Martin Jonnson's,   where we could follow his slides - even later offline - one by one,   to create a graph.   My recommendation is to do something similar with a complicated illustration,   so we can understand even better the process of how to start from   an empty artboard and end up with a high-quality creative illustration.</li> <li>My only critique would be to maybe ask students at the start of the course   their prior coding knowledge. As in the course information it is written   like you need R and illustrator.   But the course is actually completable with python and Inkscape/designer.   If there could be some sort of support possible for students   who prefer python over R that would be great too.</li> <li>It might be nice to introduce ggplot data visualisation earlier in week 1,   so there is a bit more time to learn to work with this programm and   already get feedback together   with the graphical abstract at the start of week 2.</li> </ul> <p>I can agree to move this earlier.</p> <ul> <li>I would have liked to have some more optional   adobe illustrator activities to do.</li> <li>There was a lot to do during the course which required more working hours   than expected, even though it probably on individual level was up   to the student to decide when the assignments were \"good enough\",   but maybe clarify what is really necessary for the course purpose   in contrast to individual development and individual choices.</li> <li>In general, I really loved to course,   so this is only small details and a personal feeling!   I felt like it was quite a lot of submissions...   but I was also attempting to make a whole poster and   there was not enough time for that...   I think it would have been less stressful to submit maybe   only a rough outline of a poster or graphical abstract   and then focus on one or two illustrations and make those really nice   using all the 3D and shading and colouring tools we learned...   For the feedback I had a hard time understanding the difference between   first and second feedback person and I think it would be fine   to just let the first person say whatever comes to mind   and the second one adding if they have any further comment...</li> <li>I feel like the use of adobe/ inkscape could have been better explained.   The slides that I used were interactive and were good,   but i had to look at further youtube videos on it as well.   I liked that there was a variety of choice of software   at varying price points, but considering i was just starting,   I used the free choice.   That was perhaps a bit more limiting in my ability to create something,   though I'm not sure as I did not try the others.   The last thing I would say is perhaps to put in some examples   of work that is not so refined and submitted to journals and magazines -   something that might be a bit more achievable for PhD/ post doc work.   Most of what we saw was of such high quality that i was inspired by it,   but had no idea how to achieve that.</li> <li>more examples of good scientific illustrations of the most common   plots -&gt; a good bar graph, regression analysis, correlation matrix,   heat map, forest plot etc.</li> <li>Maybe include one session in person for the people that are in Stockholm   or that can attend. It would be great to have the last session be   in person and receive feedback from the others.</li> <li>I guess the feedback should also be in written format from peers too.
